# Netflix-Analysis
I analyze Netflix data to identify market trends, conduct geospatial analysis, and develop a dynamic dashboard.

Throughout this exercise, I utilized Tableau to visually explore these concepts. Similarly, I also used advanced concepts like 
calculated fields, workbook formatting, dynamic slicers, etc. 

As an illustration, I created an Area Chart to explore the distribution among TV Shows & Movies on Netflix over time. Likewise, 
I created a global heatmap to explore geographic distribution of Movies and TV Shows available on Netflix for each particular country. Moreover,
I created a heatmap to get an idea about the top 10 categories on Netflix by counts as well as the distribution among them. Also, I created a Bubble 
Chart to further explore the difference among counts of Movies & TV Shows on Netflix. Additionally, I created a Column Chart to see the counts of 
TV Shows & Movies with respect to Ratings & Target Audience. Finally, I created a dynamic dashboard in which you could filter information you want
to choose a Title on Netflix. We have all been lost at one point or another with the amount of choice. But, this dashboard will give you information 
such as Director, Genre, RunTime, Description, Rating, Title, and Type of Media via a dynamic filter/slicer.
